# Hello!
If I had a nickel for every time I asked a friend to review my resume and they told me, "But, I don't really feel you're showcasing your accomplishments," I'd still need a job, but I'm sure I could have a nice dinner with the change. I created this website because I'd like to showcase the projects I've completed in both professional and academic contexts that are closest to my career objectives. I'd also like this to serve as a place for you to get to know me a bit. 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out! My github username is hello-yall as I'm always willing to chat.

## Quick Facts
**Origin:** Richmond, VA  

**Interests:** Music, 20th-century history, cars, and Scotland  

**Favorite colors:** Pink, red, and **black**.  

**Favorite shows:** King of the Hill, Rick and Morty, and Laverne and Shirley  

**"What attracted you to libraries?":** I grew up around helpful yet slightly curt librarians, and in my introverted bookworm youth, I saw it as a path where I could assist people and then they would quickly leave me alone. I very quickly found out that was not the case, and what has kept me in libraries is the high level of committment and innovation within the field. I love a challenge, and nothing makes me happier than feeling that I truly accomplished something during my day. Libraries provide me with all that and more.
