A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that originated in the United States and features chocolate chips as its distinguishing ingredient.

The traditional recipe combines a dough composed of butter and both brown and white sugar with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Variations include recipes with other types of chocolate as well as additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal.

This recipe makes 4 dozen cookies.

## Ingredients

* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup butter, softened and cut to pieces
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup light brown sugar, packed
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs
* 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)
* 1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk flour with baking soda, nutmeg and salt.
3. In a large bowl, beat butter with sugar and brown sugar until creamy and light. Add vanilla and eggs, one at a time, and mix until incorporated.
4. Gradually add dry mixture into the butter-sugar wet blend, mixing with a spatula until combined. Add chocolate chips and nuts until just mixed.
5. Drop tablespoon-sized clumps onto un-greased cookie sheets. Bake for 8-12 minutes, or until pale brown. Allow to cool on the pan for a minute or three, then transfer cookies to a wire rack to finish cooling.

  <p>This example use media queries to re-arrange the images on different screen sizes: for screens larger than 700px wide, it will show four images side by side, for screens smaller than 700px, it will show two images side by side. For screens smaller than 500px, the images will stack vertically (100%).</p>
  <p>You will learn more about media queries and responsive web design later in our CSS Tutorial.</p>
